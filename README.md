#SPOJ Scrapper
To get URL and SPOJ problem number from its name.

##The feature list:

+A neat Command line interface. ( #1 )

+Use of `html Snippets` to find content using contentFinder ( # 1)

+Persistant storage as a cache for opptimized lookup ( # 1 )

+`Content finder` is decoupled from the `Snippets` logic so can be used in other websites as well

+Use of Jinja2 to create a `template` which would be used to store the final output of the question as a text or stripped down HTML (optional).
